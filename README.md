## My process
It was a long and stressful process, but what the time. I never imagined i will spend days working 
on this particular project, i learnt alot while building the solution and it was fun. Looking forward
to work on more creative projects


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

i learnt how to make good use of some CSS custom properties

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development
Diving more into CSS this project made me realize that there is a lot of cool CSS elements that can be
very useful which are not always used in practice.
